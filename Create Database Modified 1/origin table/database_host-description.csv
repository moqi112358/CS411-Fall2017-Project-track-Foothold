Travels bring new experiences and reinforce personal roots. I am from the south of France along the Mediterranean coast. So, I cook a lot of french dishes while listening to music from the far places of Central Asia or Africa. You should try the music from Mali such as Boubacar.

I have often tasted the unique sense of hospitality that is the signature of the Afghan people. In remote mountainous regions of central Afghanistan and Pakistan, I was brought to stay many nights with families who made the best of my stay with simplicity and the riches of values in humanity. That's what I want to give back to whoever stay in my home. I have chosen to live here because of the wooden floor, and the source of natural light. Sometimes I just lay on the floor and I feel strongly connected to my own nature to value quality."

******CHARACTER REFERENCES:  

 have known Pina for 18 years since I first moved to Seattle, when she owned and operated Botticelli Caffe. 

As a frequent customer I was able to watch Pina run both the caf and another Restaurant over the years. Pina was a tireless worker, sharing her time between the caf, her daughter and all of her many friends made through the business. 

 The clientele was made up of regulars who came in for her great smile and great conversation. Tourists were always given sound advice and direct ions to all of the best Seattle sites.

I was able to work again with Pina on the purchase of my home where she was instrumental in finding the house my family enjoyed for several years along with all the close friends and neighbors Pina was able to introduce during our residence. Pina is always cheerful, dependable and tirelessly working to help those close to her.? 
                
S.B. - Interior Designer

 ******I was a tenant in an apartment building that Pina managed. From inquiring about the apartment, to leasing and maintenance, Pina proved herself to be friendly, responsive, and available. 

My husband and I felt comfortable and well supported while the building was under Pina's management. When a new manager started, there was an unfortunate and noticeable change in the sense of community within the building. 

After experiencing many other apartment managers, I rate Pina as tops. She was always professional, reasonable, and neighborly. I would be lucky to find another manager as caring as Pina.
B.S. - Transportation Consultant

****** have known Pina  for 15 years as a wonderful friend, reliable apartment manager, prosperous business owner, a professional Realtor and a wonderfully committed mother.

I'm in senior product management at Microsoft, and if I want to make clear that Pina rates highly in all areas in my opinion - interpersonal communications skills, her attention to detail, her ability to socialize or work in a group in a charismatic and professional yet relaxed manner. She would be an asset to many and scores highly in my opinion?

 R.R. - Consultant, Senior Product Management Microsoft


******ina was my agent and she did a fantastic job. She was professional, knowledgeable, patient, and persistent throughout the process.  I would definitely recommend her to anyone I know buying or selling their property.?

Movies are my passion and when I am not physically traveling, I am traveling through the camera lens by watching foreign films from all over the world.  Going to film festivals in other cities is also a treat.  The San Sebastian film festival was a wonderful experience.  As a guest, I try to be neat, clean and quiet.  I pretty much act the same as a host.   "

324630,"I have been hosting people from all over the world through Airbnb for more than three years now and have really enjoyed the experience. Chatting with guests upon check in lets me not only tell them what a great city Boston is and how much it has to offer but to also listen to stories of where they live or have been to. That's what makes Airbnb such a great community builder in my mind - connecting people from all parts and walks of life. 
Just like all of the travelers that I've hosted, I am a traveler myself - having been to a number of countries in Central Asia, Europe, and lived for a time in Micronesia. Each time I travel, I make sure to find a local connection to tell me about places off the beaten path that a tourist guide might miss, and if all else fails - I just enjoy seeing where my feet (or a local bus/train/subway) take me. So if you're looking for the best Ethiopian food in Boston or a little known museum (a whole room of the most realistic glass flowers hand blown in the 19th century), I can definitely point you in the right direction. 
Speaking of directions, I bike a LOT around town and would be happy to provide a bike when you stay at either of my places. Boston may have a great (oldest in North America) subway system, but sometimes it's just nice to get on a bike and see where the next street takes you!
What keeps me not only travelling on Airbnb but also hosting are the notes that I frequently get, letting me know what a great time someone had or how much they enjoyed visiting a part of city I mentioned to them. These notes always put a smile on my face and leave me knowing that I have made someone's visit memorable!"

We have always loved sharing our art filled home with friends from near and far and offering a relaxing refuge within the city.

Sharing Seattle's art and entertainment is always fun for us, so be sure to let us know what you might like to see, from Shakespeare in the Park, and free concerts at the Ballard Locks to Chihuly's Glass Garden, an entertaining night at Jazz Alley or how to get to one of the many sports events our city has to offer on the bus from our place.
We are very understanding hosts and know that you are in a new place and we are here to help you.  Although not part of our regular routine when you visit, if you have just flown in from half way around the world and at midnight you are starving with few options to find a restaurant serving, we can most certainly find something in our kitchen to get you through the night, from soup and sandwiches, to goodies in the refrigerator to warm up for a light supper or midnight breakfast.  We are always glad to help with direction and print out bus schedules or directions for you to take with you on your day of exploring.  We have lots of recommendations of things to see and places to shop that may not be in your guide books, and are always happy to share with you."

We are avid Airbnb guests as well as hosts. We first stayed at an Airbnb location in Sydney, Australia, while honeymooning in January 2012, and were so impressed with our experience that we are now hooked! Not only are the Airbnb properties a good value, but more importantly, we have had amazing interactions with each of the hosts at locations where we've stayed, which now have expanded beyond Sydney, AU, to include a few locations in our home state of Washington as well as cities such as Vancouver, Canada,  Portland and Bend in Oregon, San Francisco and Sonora, CA, Baltimore, Miami, and New York City and Ithaca, NY, and London, Cornwall and Bath in the United Kingdom. We've been a guest in 21 different Airbnb locations over the past 3-1/2 years. In fact, I can't remember the last time we stayed at a conventional hotel!

Since we had such great experiences as guests, we decided to start hosting in the summer of 2012 and listed our guest room on Airbnb. Hosting has proven to be a fantastic experience since we are both seasoned travelers and enjoy chatting with others about their travels, etc.

In terms of demographics, we are both in our mid-forties, have traveled all around the country (and the world) and are also are very tidy and respectful. Beyond travelling, we like listening to live music, exploring neighborhoods, having fun with our dogs, gardening and cooking great food, spending time near the water/beach, and meeting new people."

We have both used AirBnB to travel many places together (across the US and internationally) and are excited to share our extra room with interesting people.

In January 2015, we took a trip to South Africa and Lesotho and used AirBnB to book guest rooms there (That's us in front of the Baobob tree!). We have also used it within the US for short vacation spots.

I'm originally from Austin, TX (78704 is not just a zipcode; it's a way of life!), went to college in NYC, and served as a US Peace Corps Volunteer in Morocco for two years.

Ever since I was a kid doing sleepovers to my first job out of college as a Peace Corps Volunteer in Turkey all through my long and longer life, I've loved every place I've ever visited.  So maybe that's why I want to return all the great hospitality I've received.

These days I'm a realtime captioner for hard of hearing.  Which means I go to classes, meetings, conferences with students (or staff or faculty) primarily at the University of Washington and write live everything being said so the student can read it on my computer screen as it's happening.  You've seen closed captioning on TV?  It's like that, only I'm there live on site.  Love my job.  It's challenging (that is to say, hard) and can be stressful, but I am glad to be a vehicle for access to education and the workplace that people wouldn't have without that service.  The service is provided under auspices of the Americans with Disabilities Act.

There are so many things to do in Seattle, and I am happy to give you information and ideas for your stay -- or just get out of your way and let you have at it!

661691,"I rent out my WorldMark timeshare -- 120+ resort locations all over the US, Mexico, Canada, Australia, Fiji, New Zealand, and England.

My specialty is last-minute short-stay accommodations, but please be smart about your expectations: if it's less than a month before any kind of holiday, concert, or event, it's likely already booked up. Accommodations in Indio and Palms Springs sell out within an HOUR of Coachella tickets going on sale* but it's the same two weekends every year, so be smart about it. Holidays and summer weekends also book up far in advance. 

You can book as far as 13 months out.

*If you book more than 10 months out, there is a 7-night minimum.

If you want to book a Friday or a Saturday, there is a three-night minimum -- unless you are booking within 48 hours of check-in (4pm)

I have units that can accommodate as many as eight people. Have more than eight? You can rent more that one unit! The Maximum Occupancy listed on the listing is as true as gravity and cannot be altered with because the Fire Marshal said so. Respect the Fire Marshal's wisdom.

Almost all units have a complete kitchen. In addition to full-size appliances, you'll find plates, glasses, silverware, and other kitchen items. All linens, including towels, are included. You have access to all resort amenities -- that means the pool, the hot tub, the gym, free parking, etc.

Sadly, the resorts do not allow pets.

Wifi is $4.95/day or $15.95/stay. This is 100% a resort fee that I have 0% control over.

This is a timeshare. Someone at the resort might (but probably won't) try to talk you into buying a timeshare. They'll even give you a present if you say yes! Saying yes means dealing with them for the next two hours, and that's *not* why you went on vacation. BE SMART - SAY NO - GO ENJOY YOUR VACATION! :)

We've had too many bad experiences with guests from Orange County, California. If you are a current or former resident of Orange County and would like to rent from us, kindly be kind in your messages; we'll get the hint that you're a decent person and will welcome you with open arms.

***Feel good about your vacation! A portion of every rental fee goes to help purchase clothing, shoes, school supplies, medical supplies, and nutritious food for children through Children International. Learn more about Children International and consider sponsoring a child yourself!***"

We are small business owners and thought Airbnb would be an interesting new venture at a less stressful pace.  We are very casual after business hours :) and a very social couple.  We enjoy meeting people from different cultures and love to entertain.

Prez:  I have been blessed with opportunities to travel many places (or at least many places to us), love new experiences and seeing historic land marks. We take pride in our city's beauty, rich culture and past good or bad.

I've worked for myself most of my life and love being creative . I enjoy graphic design, acting rapping, video production, editing, directing, ballin' and shot callin' (a little urban humor) LOL. I truly want to do everything. I was a volunteer fire fighter with the Seattle Fire Department, EMT and certified life guard. ( I told you I want to do everything)

I have a lot of day activity and nightlife connections with the transportation company I manage, if you want to do a little exploring- we've got the hook up.  We like to let our guests determine if they want some private personal time while using our space or want the works with sight seeing suggestions and even the option of tagging along with us for some fun. (Warning it can get a little crazy with us, especially once the party bus gets rolling, lol ). It is very common to see buses coming or going from our property at various hours of the day and night.  You can book airport / train / bus pick ups and drop off'(email hidden), please enter airbnb as the referral to receive a discount.

We are open to any and all guests as along as everyone is respectful and polite.  Your race, sexual preference or religion is respected as long as you extend the same respect. Our space has its own keyless entry so you're welcome to come and go as you please without worrying about disturbing the rest of the house. 

I hope to have you stay with us...check out our reviews and book a night!

PS: THIS IS NOT A 5 STAR HOTEL, WHATS IN THE PHOTOS IS IN THE HOUSE.

I have a husband, Ben, whom I love very much. We're recently married in June 2015! My friends would say that I'm a neat and thoughtful houseguest, and a natural tour guide as well as host.

This city has it all: The mountains, the ocean, museums, theater, culture, and world-class restaurants.  There are plenty of indoor and outdoor activities to suit everyone.  An added bonus: Seattle is one of the few cities in the U.S. where you don't have to own a car.  I haven't owned a car since I moved here!
I moved to the Capitol Hill area of Seattle because of it's central location.  You can walk to downtown in about 15 minutes.  Shopping and restaurants on Capitol Hill's major thoroughfare are four blocks away.

I love good local food and can give you lots of great recommendations for healthy options, and of course the best local coffee and beer.

The experience is always richer when you stay with ""locals"" which, to me, gives a real sense of what their part of the world is really like.  A curious person by nature, exploring new locations is something I love.  Very much a people person who enjoys good conversation. Eclectic by nature, I have a wide range of interests. If there is anything else you would like to know? Please ask."

About me:
I am 34 years old born in Seattle and grew up just outside the city in Kirkland, WA. I know the area very well and can offer great insights if you let me know a bit about what your plans are and what you would like to do and explore. As for me, recently I have been spending a lot of time on my new boat and doing restoration work. I'm around and responsive to general questions or recommendations. 

My dog:
I have a female dog named Lucky who is about 8 years old now and comes with me sometimes. She still acts like a puppy and has a bad habit of jumping up on people that I don't think I will ever train her out of. Lucky is harmless and has never bitten anyone but she can become territorial at times. 

A little more about my background if your curious:
I am a former pro athlete who has worked as a personal trainer and group exercise instructor. I transitioned from one on one training to group exercise sessions leading hour long classes aimed at high intensity cardio, targeted strength building movement patterns and stretching. I'm not currently teaching but am working on the choreography for my next class/bootcamp and hope to teach again soon. I'd love to have my guests join when that time comes.

1651480,"MY THOUGHTS on the BostonMarathon2013 tragedy It's just 8 short block from my house, 8 brief minutes north.  I want to thank so many of you who wrote on April 15.

Although I'm usually at The Finish Line on Boylston St near Dartmouth, this year I was at Home Depot picking up the final materials and fixtures for finishing up Project 158. 

And this Tuesday April 16 morning...   I couldn't sleep, I woke, wrote, went back to bed, got up again, and wrote some more. 

 I'm writing from Boston's Historic South End, it's 4:45am birds are beginning to sing. Sirens can be heard in the distance now. I live eight brief minutes on foot from the Marathon's Finish Line. I'm still in shock. Very sad and very angry that this could happen. Especially in this city, one of the most peaceful and progressive in the country.... happen in front of our library, the first public library in the country during a ""people's sporting event"". We are a city with many ""sport's palaces"" but this event is for the every citizen. It's not dominated by high salaries and expensive admission. It's a free event here in a city that so often makes history and writes laws that have extended social justice, rights, and freedoms to so many of us. We were the first Common Wealth and our constitution was the model for The United States Constitution which has extended rights and freedoms to so many. A constitution whose rights and freedoms are too easily limited by cynical people who sow fear and hate.
Now it's 7:24 am.. more sirens, the trash truck is trashing out back, the helicopters are again in the air, the streets are empty. Last night walking home from Foodies with salad-to-go, the few who were out walked in silence, the restaurants were closed. I'm in tears. I looking at my (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) cover photo singing with (URL HIDDEN) last March.

Our December 14 concert fades in. It was just after the senseless deaths of NewTown CT school children. Reuben, our director, introduced us singing Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah and I don't remember his exact words but they went something like... ""Today people asked me how we could be singing at a time like this, and I said HOW COULD WE NOT BE SINGING, singing Hallelujah. Cohen's, Hallelujah, a song of praise. A song that has more than 100 verses."" He went on. ""A song that needs so many verses because Cohen's asking... ASKING how do I sing praise... how do I sing Hallelujah."" 

Reuben's words stopped and our singing began, and when our singing stopped Jordon Hall rose in a standing ovation. It's was a moment I'll never forget, a Dec 14 moment, a day I'll never forget. I don't remember Reuben's exact words, and yet, I can rebuild what he said as the thought and the moment will never leave me. 

And now one day and four months later, in the middle of the month, on a day we celebrate our Patriot's, a holiday, a holy day, here in Massachusetts, in my city, my hometown, on the 17th century streets, streets I've walked countless times, there's more sudden senseless death. 

This time let's not use this sacred time as an excuse to start wars-for-profit. Here in Massachusetts we have the will to change our sadness, our loss, out anger into a social movement. Let us begin, and let us begin by singing, singing Hallelujahs.

1787819,"I'm Christine, the short term rentals manager for St. John's Apartments. I'll be your go-to gal for all questions on bookings. 

Mark Chambers and Oda Egeland have owned St. John's since January 2005.  When they bought it they were enchanted by the bones of the building.  Built in 1905, it has an old charm missing in newer buildings.  They went to work on it, remodeling every apartment, putting in new plumbing and electrical, and making it modern in almost all conveniences (no dishwashers or elevator.)  Mark did most of the work himself.  We now have several short term apartments and 17 long term apartments.  It's a great building.  They live in the country, 30 miles from St. John's, and when one of their short terms is open they stay in them. I'm sure you'll love it too!

A little bit about me: Mark and Oda hired me to manage their short term rental units, and help out as their personal assistant for whatever else! I help them throw big parties in their country home, do renovations on their barn, and entertain them with terrible jokes. I'm a big art nerd and have converted the basement of St. John's into my studio space. I love to travel - but hate feeling touristy, so I love AirBnB's people-to-people way of seeing the world. My style of hosting is mostly just let you do your thing, but I love when people drop in my office for a chat and I'm always happy to dole out some advice on Seattle! I was born and raised in this city so I know it pretty well by now, despite a decade of living elsewhere in my short life. I wrote the neighborhood guide in the guest handbook in each unit, so you can also read about some of my favorite spots in there! 

I've been pondering this nugget lately: ""trade your cleverness in for awe."" Helps to look up at the sky; there's always something awe-inspiring going on up there."

nce a journey is designed, equipped, and put in process, a new factor enters and takes over. A trip, a safari, an exploration, is an entity, different from all other journeys. It has personality, temperament, individuality, uniqueness. A journey is a person in itself; no two are alike. And all plans, safeguards, policing, and coercion are fruitless. We find after years of struggle that we do not take a trip; a trip takes us.""  -John Steinbeck"

As a host: Think Singapore airlines first-class, not a Delta red-eye the night before Thanksgiving. I believe in treating people with the utmost care and respect.

As a guest: I've traveled to 3 continents and 9 countries so far. I like to pack as light as possible (backpack preferred). I'm not afraid to drive stick (even when it's been a decade since I've last tried). Ordering off menu is always a fun adventure. I also try to avoid tourist areas and go after secretly coveted local places that only natives enjoy. I've never joined a curated tour group and I hope I never do. I've pet tigers in Chiang Mai, bathed with Yakuza in Tokyo, eaten scorpions in Beijing, shot snake vodka in Taipei, swam with jellyfish in Valencia, was marooned in both Paris and Madrid, witnessed the entire starry universe in a town just outside of Stuttgart... the list just goes on.

2238969,"Hi. Kenji here. I  don't like describing my self. Writing from my home in the JP neighborhood of Boston. Today I got to stay at home. I work freelance in film production so I get a lot of time off between projects. My job is best described as ""art department"" although, set builder, propmaker, prop, effects, set dresser... are other terms for the work I do. Anyway, art dept. is what I write on my time cards. Today I did none of that. I fixed up a couple of 80's Japanese road bikes and one 60's Raleigh 3 speed in the sun in front of our house. Me and my daughter are getting ready to go down to NYC where we will set up our wares for sale on the street in Brooklyn (15 bikes and a table of her arts and crafts). Can't wait. It's super fun to be on the street talking to the people, hearing the music from the passing traffic, smiling at the ladies, eating crazy street food, and putting people on nice bikes. This is the best kind of day for me. It's got everything, travel, all kinds of people, my daughter w/ me, friends dropping by, a couple bucks in my pocket, truck tacos, street fashion... Magdalena , my 15 year old, creative, self possessed, funny, daughter makes me feel proud and secure when she hawks her crafts. I look at her talk everyone, so confident, open hearted but savvy, and I feel like she's gonna be okay where ever she goes. The art of survival. I'm an artist. Sculptor. Went to art school. Can make anything. But what I love most to make is my way thru life. It's the best art. But unlike art it is totally accessible because everyone does it. blaa blaa... back to today... I also did some drawings for a chicken coop that I'm going to build next week with my buddy Jenny. Some local chicken activists approached us with the project. These chicken people want to repeal laws that prevent keeping chickens in the city of Boston. They would like to display some chickens at our local earth/may day festival in a clean,(hopefully) well designed, urban chicken coop. What else? I fixed the passenger side headlight of my truck, paid some bills, ate some mochi, did the dark laundry, made some calls to spread the word about a friend who is on his last legs in a fight w/cancer, pulled some bamboo shoots that were creeping ever further out of their corner of the yard. Magdalena came home tonight beaming. There was an after school dance, ice cream with friends afterwards and thrift shopping after that. She sat on the couch and gave me a play by play of her day. I love that
Well, there it is. I think that worked out pretty good. It's a good thing I didn't work today or you'd of heard all about it...
IE: today I built a city diorama in 1"":1' scale. Went pretty smooth but the tiny bus stop benches looked gigantic next to the wee news paper boxes. Weird because both were built with out straying from the 1"":1' format. It just goes to show you, sometimes it's best to set the rules aside and go with your eye and your heart. 
Anyway we want to stay at your house and we want you to stay at ours."

I love finding Just the Right Thing and comparing notes on experienceshether they're cheap eats/local brews/craft cocktails or museums, dancing, live music, and places with views. I'm using technology to make the human experience more joyful and bountiful. It's wonderful that Airbnb does this in big and small ways.

On the road I'm curious about local favorites and spots off the beaten path, and you'll usually find me with guidebooks and a working itinerary. Two of my favorite places are Paris and St. John. My craziest trip, though, was backpacking through China?2 cities in 14 weeks (phew!). My dream destinations are Italy and Ibiza. 

Airbnb hosting helps me take classes to further my career, and it's been a lovely way to experience the world from home. So thanks for booking with me, and let me know if you'd like suggestions for your itinerary. I'm looking forward to meeting you! "

We are eager to get to know Europe as the people that live here know it (not like the traditional American tourist does through cruise ships and museums).  We have learned through our travels that the advice of the local resident is always better than a guide book or brocures at a hotel, so we look forward to meeting all the wonderful people on our travels and learning from them.  

Alicia minored in Spanish in college, lived in Salamanca for a summer and speaks well enough to get by, John took some French also and can read for comprehension but does not do well in conversation (hopefully our trip will improve both of our language skills!).  

We enjoy trying all sorts of new food and wine and are very adventurous in that area.  We like to go out in the evenings, have a few drinks and maybe do some dancing.  We are also perfectly happy staying in and having a glass of wine on the patio while the sun sets.  

John is a great cook and Alicia is great at cleaning, tidying up and great with kids as she is a nanny in the States. We have no problem pitching in and helping out with dinner or the chores when the time calls.  

I hope this helps shed some light on who we are, though we know that we can't tell everything in this little description.

She has many positive reviews on airbnb and she is outgoing and detail oriented -- she pays more attention on cleanliness and weather you are comfortable or not. She wants me to take care of this property so this is my new experience on airbnb but she still does the final inspection to make sure the units are clean and satisfactory. I believe you will like it just like other satisfying guests."

I'm a friendly person who typically enjoys meeting and chatting with people very much, though I'm also a person with firm boundaries and I respect other people's, as well. My son has picked up the friendliness, and is wonderful at greeting people and usually charms them as well. He's still working on the boundaries, though, since he's a toddler. :)

3118422,"Here we go. I'll make myself sound extremely fun to be around.

Let me just say one thing first: I love pork. There's nothing better than roasted pork tenderloin, perhaps wrapped in bacon with a honey, balsamic vinegar, and red wine sauce. I could eat pork breakfast, lunch, and dinner. 

I'm from California, so I'm not a typical Northwestern person. I like recycling, but composting is the absolute worst. I like saving the world and being green friendly, but I'm also cheap and hate buying more expensive green products. 

I love to travel and experience new things. I'm always looking for an inexpensive getaway for a week or weekend. (We may have that in common?) I'm also an introvert, which makes me kind of a contradiction since I'm also really loud and possibly obnoxious. 

My life motto: Don't be an a-hole. And that is the truth. And be extra nice to people in service jobs, k thanks.

People tell me I'm funny. It's true. I am funny. Someone told me I'm captivating the other day. That just makes me roll my eyes though.

I am a fanboy for Jurassic Park. It's my favorite movie, and I will not tolerate anyone disliking it! You can dislike numbers 2-4 though. I won't fault you that. Maybe just don't bring it up. ;)

I'm also a ridiculous fan of Game of Thrones/A Song of Ice and Fire. Maybe you'll see my tattoo from the novels. MAYBE NOT.

My favorite all time place to travel is South Lake Tahoe. I grew up going there every year, and it just doesn't get any better than that. There is something particularly magnificent about its smell. Pine trees are my favorite. You might notice that in my tree-themed library/entryway. I love trees.

Places I've traveled to: Caribbean, France, Spain, Italy, Monaco, Israel, England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, Ireland, Sweden, Norway, Hawaii, Grand Canyon, Chicago, Boston, Vancouver, BC, Portland, OR, Ukraine, Austria, Hungary, Thailand, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Poland, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, and New Zealand. My next trips are Iceland and South Africa! I'm visiting a past airbnb guest. I CAN'T WAIT!

Places I've lived: Sacramento area, CA, Salt Lake City, UT, and Seattle, WA.

I don't have five things I can't live without. I have one. And that is my smart phone. I will die before I give it up. It is always within a foot of me, and I feel lost without it.

As a host, I hope I'm welcoming and provide a few laughs and fantastic food recommendations. Or we might not even meet. It all depends on the day! My full-time job is unpredictable. My house may not be the place for you if you depend on having a host there all the time to make you breakfast, entertain you, or turn your bed down at night. I can either be the busiest person or the biggest couch potato in the world. Next week, I'm working 12-14 hours every day. The week after, not so much.

Cool fact: I could say ""hello,"" ""goodbye,"" ""thank you,"" and the number 2 in 5-10 languages. I was that awesome. But now I'm not as awesome and lost this skill. Help me learn again?"

More about me:
I'm an all season bike commuter (rain or shine) and I currently bike to work via the Burke Gilman bike trail. I'm a member of Warmshowers (a community of traveling cyclists and hosts) where I share my extra bedroom and bathroom (with a full shower & tub) for free to traveling cyclists. One of my guests from Portland wrote: ""Lynda has a beautiful place, and I enjoyed staying there. It's in a quiet neighborhood ""north of the cut"" so it's away from the hustle and bustle of the big city, but also right near the Burke Gilman Trail so it's just an easy ride to all that as well. Though Lynda was on a tight schedule while I was there, she made time for some very pleasant conversation. She also made sure I wanted for nothing. Her home is warm and inviting, the accommodations were very nice, and Lynda was great.""

Other  recent trips have been in Africa (the Seychelles, Uganda, Namibia and South Africa), China, Italy/Corsica and Malaysia.

This summer I've gotten to explore more of the Pacific Northwest - from Bellingham to down the Oregon Coast and the California redwoods. 

My best travel experiences have been with great hosts, and to pay that back I would love to provide a comfortable home-like experience for our guests, including access to a fully-stocked kitchen, a private bathroom, and a bedside table.

[Saul]  I never traveled far from Chicagoland as a kid but have gradually been opening up to it since I moved to Seattle in 1998.

Little Eleni (now 2 yrs old) has already flown in a helicopter over the Na Pali on Kauai, gone ice fishing in Minnesota, enjoyed art walks in Seoul Korea and squishing her little toes in the sands of Australia.

I speak French and Spanish (much better French) and I have worked in education, real estate, video, and parade art ensemble builds. 

My home is in the ""center of the Universe"" in the artsy and eclectic Fremont area - where you find the Troll under Aurora bridge, a great PCC coop, banks, shops, cafes, and a great night life as well.  

2016 Holiday Season
Holiday events in and around Fremont include the lighting of the Lenin Statue (for real), a parade of caroling boats creating truly heavenly sounds, the Fremont Arts Council Winter Feast on or close to Dec 21, great shopping for unique gifts at all the local shops, First Friday art walk, New Years Eve spectacular fire works on Lake Union, and access to all the Seattle 2016 holiday excitement including the Nutcracker with the Pacific Northwest Ballet, and Seattle Symphony's New Years Eve Party!  

Summer Solstice
The famous Fremont Solstice Parade happens every June close to summer solstice.

In 2015 I was a banner carrier with the lead Samba ensemble group Girasol.  

The Neighborhood
As to the Fremont neighborhood, I moved here years ago thinking I'd stay a couple of years but many lattes, parades  and  3 homes later, I'm still here.  We have a smaller community of artsy, smart and creative people with heart, in the middle of the big city.  I live on a hill and have a partial view of Mt Rainier on a sunny / clear day from one of the rooms and the back deck.  And it's always great to come home to this charming and awesome neighborhood.

After years, and maybe more years, I'm pretty much gluten and heavy carb free.  My cooking includes salads, chicken, veggies both raw and cooked, broths and soups, coffee, tea, coconut and chocolate desserts.  Love coconut oil and fresh salmon.
But I taste just about everything and never turn my nose up my guests regional cooking shares.

I love traveling in France and Europe in general, Mexico, the American West and Southwest, and now, South America.  My favorite way to travel is to friends or family who live there.

One of our favorite places ever is Dos Ojos in the Yucatan Peninsula. If you scuba dive, I recommend you doing the cave diving, it's an amazing experience. If you don't scuba, you can still enjoy the clear and fresh water that the cenote has. Another amazing place is the Bioluminescent lagoon in Fajardo, Puerto Rico. Our third favorite is the 7 hour train ride from Oslo to Bergen in Norway, spectacular views of the Fjords.

We travel light. We are very quiet people, we don't smoke and don't watch TV. We will spend most of our time exploring the surroundings and spend our time in the apartments just to rest and prepare for our days.

If you ever rented a private RV in San Diego you probably rented it from us, or at least ran across our business.  In fact, if you go to YouTube and search for omeGetMyRV Fox 5 News?you can see the news segment as well as other customer testimonials about the quality of rental service wee been providing since 2006.  But before you ask, and start planning an RV road trip to San Diego we sold the RV business, moved to WA, used our prior experience from that business and now have rental properties in Seattle and Sammamish. 

The Sammamish lake view property is located on the ""East Side,"" an area that is known for being more of a suburban family area, and the Seattle property is on the ""West Side"" in a suburb next to downtown Seattle, which is known for its artsy laid back and eclectic vibe.  While that was a lot of what may have been useless information to some, it was a long way of telling you that even though we don have a lot of reviews on AirBnB, we are trustworthy, experienced and work to provide customer satisfaction so that youl have the best stay possible.

5014920,"Hi, I'm Jeff and I am the Manager for the ""Architect's Gem"" in West Seattle.

I have always had a great appreciation for architecture, so it was only natural that I was happy to become the manager for this beautiful home in West Seattle for my friends Shanna & Brandon! (pictured here)

Friends who know me know that I love being a steward to houses, even working by day for a house moving company where we save full-sized Craftsman-style homes by physically *moving* them from one place to another (by land or by barge). Nickel Bros house moves have been featured on Home & Garden TV's shows ""Haulin' House,"" and on Discovery and National Geographic Channels' ""Monster Moves.""

My goal is to make your stay at the ""Architect's Gem"" one of the best you've ever had!

?Jeff

About Owners: Brandon & Shanna

A family of Architects (plus two kids), we are live a bi-coastal existence. We started our architecture firm about 13 years ago, and we've enjoyed fantastic growth, designing Green homes and Live/Work urban condominiums and apartment units throughout the Seattle area. We are proud to have contributed to the built-space of Seattle in a positive, forward-thinking way, and one of the first places we started was renovating our own home ?which you can now enjoy.

Why West Seattle:

We *love* our West Seattle home, and because we are architects we've been able to add to the home's charm over the years as we've lived in it. The house itself is a classic 1917 Bungalow, but we've added some great usable space and functionality, with an open kitchen design and warm and inviting touches architectural details. We were drawn to West Seattle because of the wonderful, varied and diverse individual urban neighborhoods that West Seattle has to offer: Admiral District (where we are); Alki Beach (must-see); Alaska Junction (the main urban core); Morgan Junction (great pub and restaurants); Fauntleroy/Endolyne (Ferry to Vashon and Peninsula, great restaurants); Westwood Village (convenient 'town centre' mall). We think you will really enjoy this comfortable and inviting house!

The Unique Benefits at this House:
 
Our home is one that you will immediately feel 'at home' with. We've designed the flow to give you both open and public spaces, as well as private nooks and quiet places to rest and relax. Fall deeply into the comfortable master bed and open up your book, or enjoy entertaining with friends or family during your stay in the large open kitchen and family room. Walk a few short blocks to the nearby pubs, bars, and restaurants, enjoy a jaunt down to Alki Beach for a nice Mexican meal at Cactus! and take a walk along the boardwalk after your dessert. During the day you can rent bikes or rollerblades and ride along the longest boardwalk (walking and biking path) in Seattle. Visit Salty's restaurant on Harbor Avenue overlooking the Seattle skyline, or even rent scuba gear and scuba dive with the local in the Elliott Bay. Or, if you want to tour the Pike Place Market by day or enjoy the Seattle nightlife downtown, hop in your car and in 13 minutes (during light traffic) you will be downtown! Take a longer ride out to Snoqualmie Pass for skiing during the winter, or hike, climb, kayak, or sail your way through the summer months in the greater Seattle area.

6031552,"I am a fun-loving world traveler, cook, gardener, artist and reader. One of my biggest pleasures in life is learning about a new place, new people, new food- both through my own travels and as a host.  My friends would describe me as active, open, engaging, funny and liberal. I was raised in the deep South of the USA (Georgia), the youngest of 5 siblings, but have lived in Seattle for 25+ years. Seattle is a hot bed of music talent, and I take advantage of it by staying updated on emerging talent and attending as many live performances as I can. I am often the oldest person there, but so what! You could not ask for a better city to live in if you are a foodie, as I am.  The variety here is unbelievable. My profession is Interior Design, so of course, design and art are an important part of my life. Books, and more books- don't even try to talk to me if I have a book in my hand!

I have three absolutely gorgeous and brilliant daughters who no longer live with me, which naturally makes them even more attractive! They live in Los Angeles and San Francisco and I visit them often.

My travels have included, but are not restricted to: most of the states within the USA, Canada, Mexico, Guatemala, Argentina, Cuba, France, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Croatia, Slovenia, Morocco, South Africa, Viet Nam, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and China. I love hiking, camping, and staying places off the beaten tourist path. I will always choose a host over a hotel- how better to really learn something about the place you bothered to travel?

Once upon a time, I spoke pretty decent Italian, but am rusty and out of practice. I would love some Italian guests to practice with (or rather, ""with whom to practice"", as I will claim to be a grammar expert). My French is even rustier. I have begun to study Spanish recently. I have a great love of the English language and grammar- yes, I was that person in school who loved diagramming sentences, and always had my hand in the air to answer the grammar questions while everyone else's eyes were rolling back in their heads! I am TESOL certified (Teacher of English as a Second Language), and hope to live abroad and teach at some point in my future. In the meantime, I have volunteered to teach English to refugees here in Seattle. Combining hosting and teaching have great appeal to me.

I can't live without: Spicy food, friends and family, some crafty project, music, art, fertile soil, books, travel, and my boyfriend."

So, with being from the Midwest, trekking to the East coast, and now living on the far west coast, I have friends and family all across the country.  I travel to see the people whom I miss and care about deeply, as well as continue to see cities and areas in the US, and all over the world as well.

How do I travel and see an area?  Through food and conversation!  I love to experience a new area through the eyes and tastes of those who live in a city. I ask the locals where to get coffee and if they had only one last place to eat at in the city, where they would go.  I adore farmers markets and local shows and (website hidden), good wine, lots of sunlight, and hitting the road with my running shoes are all things I love in life.  I'm looking forward to using Airbnb on many of my future trips.  I've stayed in hotels and many bed and breakfasts on my travels.  But, sometimes I like to hit that farmers market, grab great food and whip up a great meal with wine I've snagged along the way.  Or, if I'm visiting one of my old homes, I want a place where I can ask my family to come over to talk and catch up versus always having to head out on the town.

Favorite places so far I've visited: Ireland - great scotch!  Italy - Way too many amazing qualities to list. Austin - Wonderful live music. DC - history, politics, food, hiking, and again too many to list.

I speak Spanish and have spent a lot of time traveling the world - Mexico, Chile, Guatemala, Honduras, Belize, Argentina, Peru, Ecuador, England, France, Spain, Portugal, Hungry, India, Egypt, Israel, Morocco, South Korea... You will find small treasures in the house from these distant places.

I also like the tranquility of a good book, a cup of tea, Yoga-Glo yoga, and playing guitar.  I have one under the couch if you would like to play it.

I work close by and often bike to work.  Everything is so close from this location and the house is right on the Inner-Urban bike trail, Greenlake, and close to the Burke Gilman and Ship Canal trail.  I have booked AirBnB for colleagues at work and they have enjoyed the extra amenities that you gain from booking a house rather than just a hotel room.

I am excited to share my house with you and make your stay a good one.

After work I usually like to come home, watch TV and relax, but I also love exploring Boston when I get the chance.

That's one of the best parts of being a host ... meeting the guests and sharing the comforts of the apartment. We tried to create a tranquil environment where guests can relax and feel comfortable.  Our guests often comment that the space is like a home-away-from-home and that they prefer and appreciate the organic experience that can't be found in a hotel.  

I'm the front of the house, and Ralph, my hubby of 27 years, runs the back of the house.  He is masterful at carpentry, electrical, mechanical, and plumbing work, can turn leftovers into dishes worthy of Food & Wine publication, and is as tender as a kitten with our grandkids.  

I'm a quasi-foodie expanding on my culinary skills and choices.  Translation:  I like to eat!  I also enjoy gardening, and our gardens are a constant work in progress.

My parents gave me their thirst for learning and continuous improvement, their professionalism, work ethic and dedication.

My seven years in France sharpened my taste in European pastry, Caribbean music and fed my general knowledge.

- running 10k every two days.
- learning Spanish.
- reading every book I can find by Marcel Rufin.
- watching religiously Suits every Thursday and Ballers every Sunday.

My husband and I have been using Airbnb as guests for the past 2 years and started hosting ourselves on August 2015. We are multilingual, curious about every other culture and traveling is basically a second nature (as much as an addiction).

Seattle, Washington, USA                   Member since October 2013.

Thanks for checking us out for your visit to Seattle. We would like to be your local hosts while you are here.

Barbara is a native of Austria and speaks German as well as English.  Michael is from Miami and speaks Spanish, Portuguese and some Italian.  We both had careers in the travel industry and were able to travel, study, live and work in many places around the world. In 1980, we chose Seattle as our favorite place to live, especially on Queen Anne. 

Now that we are both retired from the full time working world we have found many interesting and pleasurable activities, in addition to hosting of course that fill our time. 

These include cooking (inspired by Barbara's time as a personal chef), in-city and in-nature walking, spending quality time with our family and friends, being active grandparents, appreciating Seattle's world class arts scene (especially opera, ballet, theater & gallery arts) just to name a few. 

We are both very interested in the study of herbs and essential oils (aroma therapy). In addition, Barbara continues on as a licensed yoga therapist and teaches yoga.

Michael is involved in the growing ""movement for health"" scene. He is also developing a series of books for children (and the child in all of us) around the theme of giraffes.

Last but not least is Sammy, our 5 year old beagle. He is friendly and adorable. He helps both of us to be in the moment and connected to the outdoors as we walk through the different neighborhoods on Queen Anne. And he
doesn't bark or bay!!!

He and I travel internationally for several months durng the year, but always come back to this city for its incredible food, fun atmosphere, and because it's our home.  We live in the 'burbs (about 15 minutes away) with our Siberian Husky.

The two of us have grown up traveling. We've experienced five-star accommodations from our previous ""business"" careers in management consulting and accounting. We have also traveled through the Jordanian desert sleeping in Bedouin tents and with Northern Thailand families in bamboo huts. The common denominator that we feel makes a wonderful accommodation is when a home-y and comfortable space.  We've designed the apartment with this in mind. All ceramic pottery pieces were designed by my Aunt Sally. All framed prints and canvases were photographed by Jason or myself. 

When traveling, our main focus is always food. We love our meats and seafood.  The one thing that makes my eyes pop is dessert. Jason is all about his red wine, scotch and other classic drinks.  Our second focus is the local experience. There is so much more to a city than historical buildings, duck  boat tours, and the Freedom trail (all of which are amazing).  There are the North End side streets for delicious lobster rolls, local markets (like the South End SOWA), and really interesting one-day volunteer opportunities.

Favorite shows: live comedy, live music of all genres except Country (sorry!). Favorite food: all foods, especially spicy things, sugary things and tropical fruits and vegetables. But, if I had to narrow it down to something I could live on forever, I'd go for Turkish, Thai or South Indian cuisine. As a guest, I am very ?inwardly and/but easy going outwardly. As a host I aim to be practical and accommodating but I am hands-off unless you request that I not be hands-off. I don't have a life motto but maybe if I did it would be ""Carpe carpere!"""

10657225,"Hi there! I've been bitten by the travel bug, and although I do a fair bit of ""roughing it"" while backpacking in the wilderness, I still like to travel in comfort to the metropolitan areas of the world. That's where Airbnb comes in because staying at someone's home is way cozier than a standard hotel room.

My favorite international destination so far is India with its delicious food, ancient-yet-thriving temples, and gorgeous art and landscapes. A close second  is the Atacama Desert and Patagonia in Chile. The geographical formations are unreal! 

As a guest, I am very conscientious, and will strive to both enjoy your home and leave it just as I found it. I also love meeting people, and would be happy to share a meal, grab drinks, or even just have a conversation with my hosts, if you're up to it and time allows. Thanks for having me!

As a co-host with my boyfriend, Ross, we want you to have the best stay possible, so please make yourself at home. If you need anything, just ask and we'll try to make it work for you. We enjoy getting to know our guests if time allows, but totally understand if you came for peace and quiet.

One of the great things that I enjoy in Boston is it open space.  My home is located within several blocks of three of those great parks.  Another great treasure in the Boston area--and one of the reasons that I moved to Boston--is it location on the ocean, and the opportunity to sail.  You can go on whale watches, cruises around the harbor, or take the water taxi to visit Old Ironsides.  Boston also has wonderful museums and a great public transportation system to take you there.

I also like traveling and seeing new places, having time to really experience a place, walking around, people-watching, and trying local favorites. 

When traveling, I try to be economical while also making sure I have a full, rich experience. I think there are plenty of great places to stay, restaurants to try, and experiences to have that are special and don't have to cost a fortune. 

As a host, I want to help my guests have the best experience possible. If that consists of giving them suggestions or even helping them with transportation, I am happy to oblige. If they just want me to show them the space, give them the key, and nothing more, that is fine too. Seattle is a great place, and everyone should be able to experience it in the way that suits them best.

As a guest, I am very respectful of the space I am using. I take care with other people's property and always follow my rule of leaving things in at least as good of a state as I find them."

Seattle has more places to eat breakfast than most major cities twice our size and we have 2 Happy Hours in Seattle. The usual afternoon/early evening and the late 10pm-1am, great after a show or concert.  We are a professional couple that enjoys reading, meeting new people, avid music fans and of course traveling. I have been a guest at many other Airbnb homes and enjoyed meeting new people and relating to a neighborhood instead of a hotel lobby. When we decided to become hosts our goal was to provide both the comfort and amenities of an upscale hotel and the feel of a home in an amazing neighborhood. We are close to everything with enough distance from the busy downtown corridor that finding a quiet park or sidewalk restaurant you can walk to from the studio lends the opportunity for a variety of memorable experiences.

I moved to Boston five years ago after having lived for more than 30 years in three different countries on as many continents.  I have a passion for travelling  and, since my migration to Boston, have so enjoyed  the experience of hosting other travelers through Airbnb, in addition to  a non-paying website.  I love that people from vastly different corners of the world, and its multiple paths,  arrive on my doorstep; I also love being of service, and sharing my resources (including my cat. :-)

I'm an educator, artist, cook, polyglot, nature-lover, film aficionado, social-justice activist, and mother to an enchanting fur-person.  I try my modest best to live with care, consciousness and compassion.

My hosting style? 
Flexible. I want my guests to have the experience they are hoping for. If you want a quiet haven, you'll have it. You can be as independent and have as much alone time as you like. But if you want to have coffee with me in the morning, or watch a movie, or walk down to the beach with me and my dog to get some exercise and see the beautiful Puget sound - I like that too.

I used to read and (try to) speak French and German. If you speak either of these feel free to try it out on me, but go slow and be patient!

As a guest?
If I'm travelling for enjoyment, I like getting to meet and interact with my host a little bit. I want the chance to meet new people and discover how they live and what their neighborhoods are like. 
If I'm traveling for business, I will probably want a quiet and organized place to come back to and rejuvenate after a day of hard work.

Do I have a life motto?

John Steinbeck:
""A kind of light spread out from her.
And everything changed color.
And the world opened.

And a day was good to awaken to,
And there were no limits to anything,
And the people of the world were good, and handsome.""

I can't live without staying connected to my friends, speaking to people from different countries and backgrounds, a daily workout, Trader Joe's, and my family,  which includes my hard working husband my son who works in tech in San Francisco, and daughter who is in the Coast Guard.
We are empty nesters, so we decided to make the lower half of our house an AirBnb.  It was an obvious choice because we travel a lot and we enjoy meeting people from all over the world.  We are new to the AirBnb community.  We have a legal unit with all the permits so instead of just renting the space out, we decided that it would be more fun and exciting be hosts for the new sharing economy.  
As an airbnb host, my number one priority is to make you feel completely at home.  I will be available as much as you want or I will stay out of your way.  The downstairs is completely separate.  You will have your privacy.  Our house is in the Laurelhurst part of Seattle.  It is fitted with everything you could possibly need to have a cozy and warm time, including a gas fireplace with a remote, full bath with heated floors.  The wifi works great.
We have so many glorious memories in this house, we will do whatever we can to make your stay in Seattle great.
My favorite quote is from Helen Keller, ""Life is either a daring adventure or nothing at all"",  being a host for AirBnb has been a daring adventure and it has given energy to our empty nest."

I took my first international trip at 9 years old, to Mexico with my mother and two of my older sisters, it was magical and lit a spark in me for traveling and experiencing new places and people. At 17 I traveled to Brisbane Australia where I lived for two months. They drank. They were chill. At 21 I headed for Capetown South Africa, where I blessed to spend 3 months studying, traveling and building relationships. The people I met  on this trip are still positively influencing me today. At 26 I sold my car and bought a ticket to Xela, Quetzaltenango Guatemala where I spent one month with some of the most warmly-spirited people you could ever hope to meet. I attended Pop-Wuj, a local language school and community restoration group, and the Trama Textile weaving school/non-profit business, where I was surrounded by gorgeous textiles full of the colors and stories of the various villages in the area. If you ever make it to Xela, I would check out the love-work being done in both of these spaces. 

Traveling the United States became a passion of mine after I road-tripped to Chicago from Seattle with one of my best friends. I was in awe of the land and the skies and felt a renewed sense of this place. I realized that even if I wasn't traveling internationally, I still had opportunities to travel in my home country, and there is just as much to 'know' and see here as anywhere else-AND SO THE ERA OF ROAD TRIPS BEGAN!. My family road tripped up and down the west-coast my entire childhood but the Midwest and South were uncharted territory for me......

There are some other secret spaces and places, that are for me and my memories to hold, places and destinations so special only a wrong-turn and open heart could have made it so :)

I have made the space I live in a home over the past 6 years and appreciate the evolution. I hope to meet you, hear and become a part of your story soon :) Much love, Jen"

18190121,"Option 1: Urban Oasis, which is available every day, all year round, is a lovely, cozy, one bedroom mini-apartment, complete with a gorgeous patio and gardens.

Option 2: The PINK ROOM, available every day all year round, is a beautiful private room in our three bedroom home. This custom built (by me, with help) house, is an urban artist's paradise that feels like a cottage in the woods. 

A BIT ABOUT ME: 
If I were to pick two single, most important characteristics to describe in myself, I'd choose that I am an artistic maker of things & spaces, and that I adore being a person. 

HMMM... WHAT DO I LIKE?  
Well, I'm an avid and high-speed reader. The apartment, the Pink Room, and my home are filled with books. 
Language, for me, holds an endless fascination. While I am not multi-lingual, I consider communication a most important human activity. Telling and listening is, when practiced, what brings the world together. Additionally, my daughter, who is still at home and often my co-host, is fully bi-lingual in Russian and English, as well as being fairly proficient in ASL. We both have some Spanish. My hope is that guests trust that whatever their point of origin, they will feel comfortable here.

Feeling at home in the world, for myself, my family, and others, has always been a vital theme for me. I've lived and worked on St. Kitts in the West Indies, hosted several different exchange students from Russia, given  presentations about Solar Energy in Kenya, lived in the woods in Northern Vermont, worked with trauma survivors for much of my career, taught building skills and trades work, and in these last many years, found a way to thrive in an urban environment.

As a mother of 3 and 'Babaka' now to two grandchildren, my core beliefs about staying in my own integrity, living out of my deepest artistic sensibility, and trying with a tenacity that never stops, have served me well.

My style as a host for Airbnb is to offer, as best I can, as little, or as much, as is wanted by my guests.

18422078,"I am a native Seattle-ite who grew up in West Seattle.  I lived on Capitol Hill in a condo until moving to this house on North Beacon Hill in 2002.  This neighborhood is RELATIVELY close to downtown (but not IN downtown) and convenient for AirBnB guests with vehicle who are looking for a compromise between hostel and motel or else don't mind riding public transit or using UberX and Lyft to visit all the major tourist sights.

I spend most of my time reading or on my computer in my office. I am a self-employed property manager who lives/works from home so talking to guests who visit is a refreshing break from a mostly solitary life.  I have a degree in English literature and traveled widely before settling down and ""getting married"" to my house.  I am happy to rent extra space in my home out as long as you are a clean, quiet, self-sufficient and low-maintenance guest.  Please note AirBnB does not do criminal background checks so when I get a request I WILL look your name up on the internet to see if you appear to have a ""safe"" profile.  Please make sure your booking request includes the information I request for best results. I started hosting people in July 2014.  As a host I need guests to make sure they understand what they are getting. I don't want a guest who doesn't bother to read my listing, then gives me less than 5 stars for things they should've expected before arriving (such as LOCATION - how does a host fix their Location? It's on the map!) or Value (did you not search other listings first? If you want Value join the homeless and go pitch a tent downtown! They have a better location, no house rules, and don't have to recycle!) If you don't understand the cost of owning real estate  in Seattle with its property taxes, sales taxes, cost of utilities and insurance rates, then don't review me on your assumptions of what you think the room price should be here without doing some comparison shopping first. We're not in Kansas anymore, Toto!  Bottom line: I offer cheap room rentals for short-stay travelers as long as they are well-behaved guests. If you are looking for hotel quality accommodations at this price on Airbnb - you're just NOT going to find it unless you pay hotel quality prices or stay in a place much further out from downtown.

If you are new to AirBnB please look up the internet article:
Read These Tips, or Nobody Will Ever Let You Be an Airbnb Guest Again.  

If you are considering becoming a host yourself, I recommend looking up AirBnB Horror Stories and AirbnB Rental Nightmares to understand the risk and liability involved in being one.

Like a significant amount of ""middle aged,"" folks I am not only an empty nester - but have recently become single and am rediscovering myself and life. What a fascinating journey that is. One of the big steps that I took was to move into the city - my motivation for the move was that I thought it would be a lot more fun than living in the suburbs. I was correct. There is never a dull moment in the city! The people watching is captivating - the culture is bright, enthusiastic and alive with a feeling of constant rebirth - students moving in, moving out, medical professionals coming in and then moving on, business professionals attending conventions and tourists visiting our fine city and then returning home - It is truly a magical place and there is no where that I would rather be - well...ok - maybe I would like to be in Namibia, South Africa.

I come from a large family, and I have a large family.  I love them all!  I am a sister to three brothers and two sisters.  I have five children along with their five spouses, who have blessed me with eight grand children.  I guess that means that I identify primarily as a mother and a grandmother.

I am also a Licensed Massage Therapist currently with a small practice in  my home.  

I love to learn about and put into practice natural and healthy food and dietary choices, sustainable living choices, natural healing methods, etc.

We often travel to Hawaii, since one son lives there with his family.  We also like to go to Mexico and Canada.  I like staying in homes, apartments or condos because I like having my own kitchen or kitchenette.  An unfortunate natural gas exposure has left me with extreme sensitivity to petroleum products, and consequently many scented products and foods.  This requires me to ask about heating and cooking fuels in homes, as well as cleaning products or strongly scented products used therein.

My father was a Scout Master and took us camping a lot.  He taught us to always leave a place cleaner than we found it.  I still do that!  My husband often tells me that I am doing the maids job when I clean up a place before I leave it, but I can't help it...it is ingrained in me.  My kids thought I was a bit of a neat freak, but I've noticed that they learned well, and they all know how to clean and they keep their homes tidy...even the boys.  Needless to say, I would take good care of anyone's place that I stayed in.

Living in a vibrant city surrounded by the natural beauty of gorgeous bodies of water and fantastic mountains is poetry for the soul! We actually don't travel as much as we would like as we always seem to be working on projects and are homebodies, but at least we enjoy the region around us. We also love dining out at the restaurants that Edward works on!

We are a newly married couple with a healthy curiosity for travel and culture. For our honeymoon we backpacked around the world in 10 unforgettable months. We came back to the states to attend Graduate School at the UW and put down roots here in gorgeous Seattle. I, Yedida, am originally from Portland, OR and Vincent is from Eastern WA, so we know the Pacific NW like the back of our hand. 

We enjoy cooking, being outdoors, exercising, reading and dancing (well, that's just me!). Travel remains our number one love. I remain loosely connected to the international community through my work as an Italian instructor. 

We are very open people who are used to travel, meeting new people and sharing community space. During our honeymoon we utilized both (website hidden) and WWOOF (World Wide Organization of Organic Farming) to gain a deeper perspective of the countries we were visiting. Nevertheless, we absolutely respect privacy and the need for quiet or alone time. We will be happy to let you do your own thing if that's your preference, but we will be equally happy to share the communal spaces in our home. 

We have a roommate, Kevin, who occupies the basement floor of the house. Kevin is an accomplished pastry chef and works a lot in the summer. You will catch him in the kitchen cooking up all sorts of yummy treats for us!

I'm amazed by how many new restaurants and bars have opened in the last couple of years, and like to try new spots whenever possible; having said that, as a vegan I do have my favorites.  I have an art background and enjoy visiting the SAM, and also like to bob my head with the rest of the crowd at many of Seattle's many music venues. I volunteer at the local animal shelter, am a huge fan of innovative design, and sometimes can be found on a yoga mat.

Occasionally we will take the resort route but for the most part we prefer to stay in other people's homes for a home away from home experience. We've done home swaps with other families as well.

We often travel to Southeast Asia and love Mexico and other tropical destinations. The PNW is a unique travel destination.

I've got a wicked case of wanderlust so travel quite a bit-- and I figured why not share my cute little bachelorette pad with the masses while I'm gone? 
I'm pretty new to this whole AirBnB thing, but I'm excited to be apart of this cool little community-- feel free to ask me any questions!

42940083,"Before I introduce myself, I want you to know this is a basement studio in a 110 year old home.  I made it as comfortable as possible for you, but it is hard to combat age and for lack of a better word,  basementness. If you are short, on a budget, or used to the youth hostel lifestyle, this may be the place for you. 

I am a professor at the UW, here in Seattle.  In the winter I am a pretty serious about hitting the mountains for skiing and snowboarding.  

When I was eleven years old, I saw Star Wars Episode 4, and I haven't been able to concentrate since then. Even though I am solidly into middle age, I love living in my super hip Seattle neighborhood, and I still go see live music a couple times a month.  

In my twenties and thirties, I would backpack through Europe once or twice a year.  One of the greatest things I ever did was decide to rent an apartment in Prague for a week instead of staying in a hotel or hostel.  I decided to create this little, private, room in my house so that young travelers ( maybe you?) can visit Seattle on a budget. 

I have traveled all over the world, maybe I have visited your town? 

What type of place is this?

Are you looking for an expensive, warm, plush, modern room with great light and tall ceilings?  If so, you should probably move on.  This is a tiny, private room with a private entrance and private bathroom in my basement.  Basements have LOW ceilings, about 6 foot 2 inches, with a low beam that folks taller than 5 foot 9 will need to duck under.  In the winter, basements tend to be cold and damp, there is no way to avoid this. I will provide you with a radiant heater so that you can keep it warm if the ambient heat isn't enough for you.   It has a full size fridge, a coffee pot, a TV, wired and wireless internet, a small bed, a desk, a microwave, a coffee maker, a teapot, a pizza oven.... If you are short, ( ceiling is only 6' tall) if you are a traveler on a budget, if you are used to staying in 2 star European hostels and hotels, and sharing a bath with 20 other people, this place will be perfect for you. 

Basically, this is a Hobbit hole, if you are looking for someplace super nice, move on.  If you are looking for something affordable in an AMAZING NEIGHBORHOOD this may work for you.  

You can walk downtown in 35 mins, 10 mins to Broadway, and 3 mins to grocery stores, bars, and amazing restaurants...

What type of host am I?

You may never even see me.  Once we make arrangements, I will give you the map, the code to the electronic lock, and you can come and go as you please.

I came to this city thinking I would get out as soon as I finished school, but learned that I needed to stay here. I love the young, intellectual, vibrant communities that make up Boston. 

I grew up overseas, in the tiny country, Kuwait. I traveled a lot throughout my adolescence and have also studied abroad in Spain. The next place I would like to visit is Morocco. 

Airbnb is such a great idea. I am new to airbnb as a host, but I have been hosted before as a guest of friends who did all the work through their accounts. This is why my profile is new, although I am accustomed to the way things work on this site.

Please feel free to contact me to ask me any questions, or if you want to hear my voice to assure that I am a real person. You never know these days . . . my roommate tried to buy a puppy online and it ended up being a fraudulent agency that tries to scam people for money. So, yeah just reach out to me and I will be more than happy to give you more details about myself or my place.

I hope you enjoy your travels, and get some good deals. Cheers!"

Fifteen years later, the house has been returned to its former glory and welcomes guests from all across the globe.

I also love being outdoors especially riding my bike around town weather permitting.

If you ask me I can send you reviews of multiple people who stayed at my home and a considerable number of those with whom I became friends.  If you prefer you can contact them directly, too.  I'd be glad to provide you with their contact information.
My  house is 2 miles to Harvard School of Medicine, Longwood Hospital area, Northeastern and a bit further but not far the medical campus of Boston University, 10 min T ride from Back Bay where you can find The Arquitectural School and MFA is 2.3 miles away.

We are Kim and Sofie. We're roommates and we're  both young professionals that work in the biotech industry. We've both been living in different areas of Boston for  a while but we love where we live now. Boston has been good to us and we could not pick a better location to be in. 
We're easy going and social. We have very busy lives so we're not always at the apartment but we like to come home to a nice, neat and clean space. 
We like to travel and do so as much as we can. In all our travels we like to stay in nice places where the environment feels like home away from home. 
We want to share one of the three bedrooms in our apartment and become those hosts that provide that same quality experience to others.  "

The setting is like a dorm roommate/share set up. You have one side of the room and I got the other side.

The metro is directly on the side of the apartment so you are mins away from downtown and other popular areas.

Great room. Awesome location.

I believe in humanity and by helping each other reach our personal goals, together working as one unit, we, Human beings of Light will accomplish all and build our utopia together. Thank you AirBNB and I also thank you all for taking a look at my page.
